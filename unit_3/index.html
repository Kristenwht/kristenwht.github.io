		<h2>About</h2>

			<img src="images/workshop-stock-photo.jpg">
		
				<p>Deep in the Appalachian Mountains in small towns, craftsmanship and tradition remain unfettered and forgotten by the outside world. In a society of simplicity and hard work, the skill of its artisans remains unmatched. Crafts are taught from master to apprentice, improved upon, and the cycle repeated generation after generation. Arthur and Son's is a representative of several of those master craftsmen who specialize in carpentry. Their work is a blend of old-world craftsmanship and a genuine desire to create true American works of art.</p>
